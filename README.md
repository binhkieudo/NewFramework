# RISC-V Framework

## Instructions

Clone using:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/binhkieudo/NewFramework.git
cd NewFramework
git checkout dev
```

## Install conda enviroment

Download and install Anaconda first

```shell
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
sudo chmod a+x ./Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Then install conda-lock for "base" environment

```shell
conda install -n base conda-lock=1.4
```

Install additional dependencies

```shell
sudo apt-get install libguestfs-tools
```

Add read privileges to the kernel

```shell
sudo chmod +r /boot/vmlinuz-*
reboot
```

## Build chipyard enviroment

Active coda first

```shell
conda activate
```
Then build the related tools

```shell
echo y | ./build-setup.sh -s 9 -s 8 riscv-tools
```

## Active chipyard environment

You have to active the chipyard environment whenever working with chipyard framework.

```shell
source env.sh
```

## Prepare SD-card 
You'll need the gptfdisk tool to format the SD card

Download and install gptfdisk
```shell
git clone https://github.com/tmagik/gptfdisk.git
cd gptfdisk
make -j`nproc`
```

Connect the SD-card to your PC, then:
```shell
cd gptfdisk/
sudo ./gdisk /dev/sd?
```
Where ? points to the SD card.

After opening the SD card, check the existing partitions by pressing p, then Enter.

Delete all existing partitions by command d with the corresponding partition's number.

After formatting the SD Card, print the new partition and save the configurations.

## Build your first tiny FPGA prototype (currently support Arty100T, VC707, VCU118)

Vivado must be in your PATH

To reduce the BootROM size

In file /riscv_framework/generators/rocket-chip/src/main/scala/devices/tilelinkBootROM.scala

Replace line 79
```shell
rom.array() ++ subsystem.dtb.contents
```
by
```shell
rom.array() //++ subsystem.dtb.contents
```

Enter framework folder
```shell
cd framework
```

Build the bitstream with your selected configuration.
```shell
make SUB_PROJECT=vc707_rocketsmall bitstream
```

After generating ".bit" file, connect the VC707 board to your PC (make sure that the rules for Digilent cable are defined beforehand). Then program the board.
```shell
make download_bitstream
```
